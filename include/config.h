 * this head file contain some macros used to verify the compiler and update logs etc.

 *
 * Overview:
 * 1. send_msg (series) means send_msg, send_native_msg, safe_send_msg, safe_send_native_msg, direct_send_msg, direct_sync_send_msg,
 *    broadcast_msg, broadcast_native_msg, safe_broadcast_msg, safe_broadcast_native_msg.
 * 2. the top namespace (st_asio_wrapper) usually is omitted, for example, socket indicate st_asio_wrapper::socket, tcp::socket_base indicate st_asio_wrapper::tcp::socket_base.
 * 3. send_msg (series) success just means the message has been moved (or copied) to st_asio_wrapper, it will be sent in the future automatically.
 * 4. Messages being sent have been moved out from the input queue, so they cannot be fetched via get_pending_send_msg_size and
 *     pop_first_pending_send_msg, so does output queue.
 *
 * Known issues:
 * 1. since 1.3.5 until 1.4, heartbeat function cannot work properly between windows (at least win-10) and Ubuntu (at least Ubuntu-16.04).
 * 2. since 1.3.5 until 1.4, UDP doesn't support heartbeat because UDP doesn't support OOB data.
 * 3. since 1.3.5 until 1.4, SSL doesn't support heartbeat because SSL doesn't support OOB data.
 * 4. with old openssl (at least 0.9.7), ssl::client_socket_base and ssl_server_socket_base are not reusable, I'm not sure in which version,
 *    they became available, seems it's 1.0.0.
 * 5. since 1.0.0 until 2.1.0, async_write and async_read are not mutexed on the same socket, which is a violation of asio threading model.
 *
 * change log:
 * 2012.7.7
 * Created
 *
 * 2012.7.7 - 2016.7.7
 * Beta edition
 *
 * 2016.7.7		version 1.0.0
 * First release
 *
 * 2016.7.17	version 1.0.1
 * Support boost-1.49, it's the minimum version for st_asio_wrapper because of boost::container.
 *
 * 2016.8.7		version 1.1.0
 * Add stream_unpacker to receive native data.
 * asio_server and test_client are now able to start with configurable thread number.
 * Add efficiency statistic for performance tuning, and it can be shut down.
 * Add pingpong test.
 * Move packers and unpackers out of 'include' directory (now in 'ext' directory), they don't belong to st_asio_wrapper library.
 *
 * 2016.8.16	version 1.1.1
 * Fix bug: the last msg will not be re-dispatched if on_msg_handle returned false until new msgs come in.
 * Drop timer TIMER_SUSPEND_DISPATCH_MSG, it's useless.
 * Send more msgs in one async_write call.
 * Fix annotations.
 *
 * 2016.9.4		version 1.1.2
 * Renamed proxy_buffer to auto_buffer.
 * Added a new replaceable buffer shared_buffer.
 * Fix bug: if receive buffer overflow and on_msg() returns false (which means using receive buffer),
 *  st_socket will call on_msg() again and again (asynchronously) for the same msg until receive buffer becomes available.
 *
 * 2016.9.13	version 1.1.3
 * Support optional timers (deadline_timer, steady_timer and system_timer).
 * Split ext/st_asio_wrapper_net.h into ext/st_asio_wrapper_client.h, ext/st_asio_wrapper_server.h and ext/st_asio_wrapper_udp.h.
 * Add virtual function st_server_base::on_accept_error, it controls whether to continue the acceptance or not when error occurred.
 *
 * 2016.9.22	version 1.2.0
 * Add st_socket::on_close() virtual function, if you defined ST_ASIO_ENHANCED_STABILITY macro, st_asio_wrapper guarantee this is the
 *  last invocation on this st_socket, you can free any resources that belong to this st_socket, except this st_socket itself, because
 *  this st_socket may is being maintained by st_object_pool, in other words, you will never free an object which is maintained by shared_ptr.
 * Add st_socket::is_closable() virtual function, st_connector need it when the link is broken and reconnecting is taking place, under this
 *  situation, we will never reuse or free this st_connector.
 * Add st_object::is_last_async_call() function, it provide 100% safety to reuse or free an object (need to define ST_ASIO_ENHANCED_STABILITY macro).
 * Rename all force_close functions to force_shutdown;
 * Rename all graceful_close functions to graceful_shutdown;
 * Rename all do_close functions to shutdown;
 * Rename close_all_client function to shutdown_all_client.
 * Rename ST_ASIO_GRACEFUL_CLOSE_MAX_DURATION macro to ST_ASIO_GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_MAX_DURATION.
 * Rename ST_ASIO_OBSOLETED_OBJECT_LIFE_TIME macro to ST_ASIO_DELAY_CLOSE.
 * Change default value of ST_ASIO_FREE_OBJECT_INTERVAL macro from 10 to 60.
 * Drop const qualifier for is_send_allowed() function.
 * Strip boost::bind and boost::ref for standard edition.
 *
 * 2016.10.8	version 1.3.0
 * Drop original congestion control (because it cannot totally resolve dead loop) and add a semi-automatic congestion control.
 * Demonstrate how to use the new semi-automatic congestion control (asio_server, test_client, pingpong_server and pingpong_client).
 * Drop post_msg_buffer and corresponding functions (like post_msg()) and timer (st_socket::TIMER_HANDLE_POST_BUFFER).
 * Optimize locks on message sending and dispatching.
 * Add enum shutdown_states.
 * st_timer now can be used independently.
 * Add a new type st_timer::tid to represent timer ID.
 * Add a new packer--fixed_length_packer.
 * Add a new class--message_queue.
 *
 * 2016.10.16	version 1.3.1
 * Support non-lock queue, it's totally not thread safe and lock-free, it can improve IO throughput with particular business.
 * Demonstrate how and when to use non-lock queue as the input and output message buffer.
 * Queues (and their internal containers) used as input and output message buffer are now configurable (by macros or template arguments).
 * New macros--ST_ASIO_INPUT_QUEUE, ST_ASIO_INPUT_CONTAINER, ST_ASIO_OUTPUT_QUEUE and ST_ASIO_OUTPUT_CONTAINER.
 * In contrast to non_lock_queue, rename message_queue to lock_queue.
 * Move container related classes and functions from st_asio_wrapper_base.h to st_asio_wrapper_container.h.
 * Improve efficiency in scenarios of low throughput like pingpong test.
 * Move class statistic and obj_with_begin_time out of st_socket to reduce template tiers.
 *
 * 2016.11.13	version 1.3.2
 * Use ST_ASIO_DELAY_CLOSE instead of ST_ASIO_ENHANCED_STABILITY macro to control delay close duration,
 *  0 is an equivalent of defining ST_ASIO_ENHANCED_STABILITY, other values keep the same meanings as before.
 * Move st_socket::closing related logic to st_object.
 * Make st_socket::id(boost::uint_fast64_t) private to avoid changing IDs by users.
 * Call close at the end of shutdown function, just for safety.
 * Introduce lock-free mechanism for some appropriate logics (many requesters, only one can succeed, others will fail rather than wait).
 * Remove all mutex (except mutex in st_object_pool, st_service_pump, lock_queue and st_udp_socket).
 * Sharply simplified st_timer class.
 *
 * 2016.11.20	version 1.3.3
 * Simplify header files' dependence.
 * Yield to Visual C++ 10.0
 * Add Visual C++ solution and project files (Visual C++ 11.0 and 9.0).
 *
 * 2016.12.6	version 1.3.4
 * Compatible edition support c++0x (11, 14, 17, ...) features too.
 * Monitor time consumptions for message packing and unpacking.
 * Fix bug: pop_first_pending_send_msg and pop_first_pending_recv_msg cannot compile.
 *
 * 2017.1.1		version 1.3.5
 * Support heartbeat (via OOB data), see ST_ASIO_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL macro for more details.
 * Support scatter-gather buffers when receiving messages, this feature needs modification of i_unpacker, you must explicitly define
 *  ST_ASIO_SCATTERED_RECV_BUFFER macro to open it, this is just for compatibility.
 * Simplify lock-free mechanism.
 * Optimize container insertion (use series of emplace functions instead).
 * Demo test_client support alterable number of sending thread (before, it's a hard code 16).
 * Fix bug: In extreme cases, messages may get starved in receive buffer and will not be dispatched until arrival of next message.
 * Fix bug: In extreme cases, messages may get starved in send buffer and will not be sent until arrival of next message.
 * Fix bug: Sometimes, st_connector_base cannot reconnect to the server after link broken.
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2017.5.30	version 1.4.0
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 * Virtual function reset_state in i_packer, i_unpacker and i_udp_unpacker have been renamed to reset.
 * Virtual function is_send_allowed has been renamed to is_ready, it also means ready to receive messages
 *  since message sending cannot be suspended any more.
 * Virtual function on_msg_handle has been changed, the link_down variable will not be presented any more.
 * Interface i_server::del_client has been renamed to i_server::del_socket.
 * Function inner_packer and inner_unpacker have been renamed to packer and unpacker.
 * All add_client functions have been renamed to add_socket.
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 * Support object restoration (on server side), see macro ST_ASIO_RESTORE_OBJECT for more details.
 * Re-implement heartbeat function, use user data (so need packer and unpacker's support) instead of OOB, now there will be no any
 *  limitations for using heartbeat.
 * Refactor and optimize ssl objects, now st_ssl_connector_base and st_ssl_server_socket_base are reusable,
 *  just need you to define macro ST_ASIO_REUSE_SSL_STREAM.
 *
 * FIX:
 * Before on_close() to be called, st_socket::start becomes available (so user can call it falsely).
 * If a timer failed or stopped by callback, its status not set properly (should be set to TIMER_CANCELED).
 * Make ssl shutting down thread safe.
 * Make reconnecting after all async invocations (like object reusing or restoration).
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Virtual function i_packer::pack_heartbeat been introduced to support heartbeat function.
 * Interface i_server::restore_socket been added, see macro ST_ASIO_RESTORE_OBJECT for more details.
 * Be able to manually start heartbeat function without defining macro ST_ASIO_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL, see demo asio_server for more details.
 * Support sync mode when sending messages, it's also a type of congestion control like safe_send_msg.
 * Expand enum st_tcp_socket::shutdown_states, now it's able to represent all SOCKET status (connected, shutting down and broken),
 *  so rename it to link_status.
 * Enhance class timer (function is_timer and another stop_all_timer been added).
 * Support all buffer types that boost::asio supported when receiving messages, use macro ST_ASIO_RECV_BUFFER_TYPE (it's the only way) to define the buffer type,
 *  it's effective for both TCP and UDP.
 *
 * DELETION:
 * Drop st_server_base::shutdown_all_client, use st_server_base::force_shutdown instead.
 * Drop ST_ASIO_DISCARD_MSG_WHEN_LINK_DOWN macro and related logic, because it brings complexity and race condition,
 *  and are not very useful.
 * Drop socket::is_closable, st_connector_base will overwrite socket::on_close to implement reconnecting mechanism.
 * Not support pausing message sending and dispatching any more, because they bring complexity and race condition,
 *  and are not very useful.
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 * Move heartbeat function from st_connector_base and st_server_socket_base to st_socket, so introduce new virtual function
 *  virtual void on_heartbeat_error() to st_socket, subclass need to implement it.
 * Move async shutdown function from st_connector_base and st_server_socket_base to st_socket, so introduce new virtual function
 *  virtual void on_async_shutdown_error() to st_socket, subclass need to implement it.
 * Move handshake from st_ssl_server_base to st_ssl_server_socket_base.
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 * Use boost::mutex instead of boost::shared_mutex, the former is more efficient in st_asio_wrapper's usage scenario.
 * Move macro ST_ASIO_SCATTERED_RECV_BUFFER from st_asio_wrapper to st_asio_wrapper::ext, because it doesn't belong to st_asio_wrapper any more after introduced
 *  macro ST_ASIO_RECV_BUFFER_TYPE.
 * Move macro ST_ASIO_MSG_BUFFER_SIZE from st_asio_wrapper to st_asio_wrapper::ext, because it doesn't belong to st_asio_wrapper.
 * Use boost::unordered::unordered_map instead of unordered_set, because we used one of the overloaded function find, which is marked as 'not encouraged to use'.
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2017.6.19	version 1.4.1
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 *
 * FIX:
 * Fix race condition on member variable sending_msgs in tcp::socket_base.
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Optimize reconnecting mechanism.
 * Enhance class st_timer.
 *
 * DELETION:
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 * Rename st_connector_base and st_ssl_connector_base to st_client_socket_base and st_ssl_client_socket_base, the former is still available, but is just an alias.
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2017.7.9		version 2.0.0
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 * No error_code will be presented anymore when call io_context::run, suggest to define macro ST_ASIO_ENHANCED_STABILITY.
 * i_unpacker has been moved to namespace tcp, i_udp_unpacker has been moved to namespace udp and renamed to i_unpacker.
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 * Add two demos for concurrent test.
 * Support unstripped message (take the default unpacker for example, it will not strip message header in parse_msg), this feature is disabled by default,
 *  you can call i_unpacker's void stripped(bool) function to enable it.
 *  udp::i_unpacker doesn't have this feature, it always and only support unstripped message.
 *
 * FIX:
 * Fix reconnecting mechanism in demo ssl_test.
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Truly support asio 1.11 (don't use deprecated functions and classes any more), and of course, asio 1.10 will be supported too.
 *
 * DELETION:
 * Drop standard edition, use ascs (https://github.com/youngwolf-project/ascs) instead, it doesn't depend boost, but can work with boost.
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 * Rename the name of classes and header files according to ascs, relocate header files according to ascs, macros been kept.
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 * Use mutable_buffer and const_buffer instead of mutable_buffers_1 and const_buffers_1 if possible, this can gain some performance improvement.
 * Call force_shutdown instead of graceful_shutdown in tcp::client_base::uninit().
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2017.7.23	version 2.0.1
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 * i_server has been moved from st_asio_wrapper to st_asio_wrapper::tcp.
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 * Support decreasing (increasing already supported) the number of service thread at runtime by defining ST_ASIO_DECREASE_THREAD_AT_RUNTIME macro,
 *  suggest to define ST_ASIO_AVOID_AUTO_STOP_SERVICE macro too.
 *
 * FIX:
 * Always directly shutdown ssl::client_socket_base if macro ST_ASIO_REUSE_SSL_STREAM been defined.
 * Make queue::clear and swap thread-safe if possible.
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Optimized and simplified auto_buffer, shared_buffer and ext::basic_buffer.
 * Optimized class obj_with_begin_time.
 * Not use sending buffer (send_buffer) if possible.
 * Reduced stopped() invocation (because it needs locks).
 * Introduced boost::asio::io_service::work (boost::asio::executor_work_guard) by defining ST_ASIO_AVOID_AUTO_STOP_SERVICE macro.
 * Add function service_pump::service_thread_num to fetch the real number of service thread (must define ST_ASIO_DECREASE_THREAD_AT_RUNTIME macro).
 *
 * DELETION:
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 * Move all deprecated classes (connector_base, client_base, service_base) to alias.h
 * Refactor the mechanism of message sending.
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 * Rename tcp::client_base to tcp::multi_client_base, ext::tcp::client to ext::tcp::multi_client, udp::service_base to udp::multi_service_base,
 *  ext::udp::service to ext::udp::multi_service. Old ones are still available, but have became alias.
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2017.9.17	version 2.0.2
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 * Function object_pool::invalid_object_pop only pop obsoleted objects with no additional reference.
 * socket::stat.last_recv_time will not be updated before tcp::socket_base::on_connect any more.
 * For ssl socket, on_handshake will be invoked before on_connect (before, on_connect is before on_handshake).
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 *
 * FIX:
 * If start the same timer and return false in the timer's call_back, its status will be set to TIMER_CANCELED (the right value should be TIMER_OK).
 * If call stop_service after service_pump stopped, timer TIMER_DELAY_CLOSE will be left behind and be triggered after the next start_service,
 *  this will bring disorders to st_asio_wrapper::socket.
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * During congestion controlling, retry interval can be changed at runtime, you can use this feature for performance tuning,
 *  see macro ST_ASIO_MSG_HANDLING_INTERVAL_STEP1 and ST_ASIO_MSG_HANDLING_INTERVAL_STEP2 for more details.
 * Avoid decreasing the number of service thread to less than one.
 * Add a helper function object_pool::get_statistic.
 * Add another overload of function object_pool::invalid_object_pop.
 * Introduce boost::asio::defer to object, be careful to use it.
 * Add link's break time and establish time to the statistic object.
 * Move virtual function client_socket_base::on_connect to tcp::socket_base, so server_socket_base will have it too (and ssl sockets).
 *
 * DELETION:
 * Drop useless variables which need macro ST_ASIO_DECREASE_THREAD_AT_RUNTIME to be defined.
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 * Move variable last_send_time and last_recv_time from st_asio_wrapper::socket to st_asio_wrapper::socket::stat (a statistic object).
 * Move common operations in client_socket_base::do_start and server_socket_base::do_start to tcp::socket_base::do_start and socket::do_start.
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 * Always use io_context instead of io_service (before asio 1.11, io_context will be a typedef of io_service).
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2017.9.28	version 2.0.3
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 *
 * FIX:
 * Support unmovable buffers (for example: a very short std::string).
 * Eliminate race condition in udp::socket_base.
 * Eliminate race condition in demo file_client.
 * Avoid division by zero error in demo file_client.
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 *
 * DELETION:
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2017.12.25	version 2.0.4
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 * Support boost-1.66
 *
 * FIX:
 * Fix race condition when controlling the number of service thread at runtime.
 * Fix compiler warnings.
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Add verification for object allocation.
 * Add log if stop_timer failed.
 * Hide variable server in server_socket_base, use get_server function instead.
 * A boolean value instead of void will be returned from set_timer and update_timer_info.
 *
 * DELETION:
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 * Move function show_info from server_socket_base and client_socket_base to tcp::show_info.
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2018.4.18	version 2.0.5
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 * Do reconnecting in client_socket_base::after_close rather than in client_socket_base::on_close.
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 *
 * FIX:
 * Reconnecting may happen in st_asio_wrapper::socket::reset, it's not a right behavior.
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Add st_asio_wrapper::socket::after_close virtual function, a good case for using it is to reconnect the server in client_socket_base.
 *
 * DELETION:
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2018.5.20	version 2.1.0
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 * Not support sync sending mode any more.
 * Explicitly need macro ST_ASIO_PASSIVE_RECV to gain the ability of changing the unpacker at runtime.
 * Function disconnect, force_shutdown and graceful_shutdown in udp::socket_base will now be performed asynchronously.
 * Not support macro ST_ASIO_FORCE_TO_USE_MSG_RECV_BUFFER any more, which means now we have the behavior as this macro always defined,
 *  thus, virtual function st_asio_wrapper::socket::on_msg() is useless and also has been deleted.
 * statistic.handle_time_2_sum has been renamed to handle_time_sum.
 * Macro ST_ASIO_MSG_HANDLING_INTERVAL_STEP1 has been renamed to ST_ASIO_MSG_RESUMING_INTERVAL.
 * Macro ST_ASIO_MSG_HANDLING_INTERVAL_STEP2 has been renamed to ST_ASIO_MSG_HANDLING_INTERVAL.
 * st_asio_wrapper::socket::is_sending_msg() has been renamed to is_sending().
 * st_asio_wrapper::socket::is_dispatching_msg() has been renamed to is_dispatching().
 * typedef st_asio_wrapper::socket::in_container_type has been renamed to in_queue_type.
 * typedef st_asio_wrapper::socket::out_container_type has been renamed to out_queue_type.
 * Wipe default value for parameter can_overflow in function send_msg, send_native_msg, safe_send_msg, safe_send_native_msg,
 *  broadcast_msg, broadcast_native_msg, safe_broadcast_msg and safe_broadcast_native_msg, this is because we added template parameter to some of them,
 *  and the compiler will complain (ambiguity) if we omit the can_overflow parameter. So take send_msg function for example, if you omitted can_overflow
 *  before, then in 2.1, you must supplement it, like send_msg(...) -> send_msg(..., false).
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 * After introduced boost::asio::io_context::strand (which is required, see FIX section for more details), we wiped two atomic in st_asio_wrapper::socket.
 * Introduced macro ST_ASIO_DISPATCH_BATCH_MSG, then all messages will be dispatched via on_handle_msg with a variable-length container.
 *
 * FIX:
 * Wiped race condition between async_read and async_write on the same st_asio_wrapper::socket, so sync sending mode will not be supported any more.
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Explicitly define macro ST_ASIO_PASSIVE_RECV to gain the ability of changing the unpacker at runtime.
 * Add function st_asio_wrapper::socket::is_reading() if macro ST_ASIO_PASSIVE_RECV been defined, otherwise, the socket will always be reading.
 * Add function st_asio_wrapper::socket::is_recv_buffer_available(), you can use it before calling recv_msg() to avoid receiving buffer overflow.
 * Add typedef st_asio_wrapper::socket::in_container_type to represent the container type used by in_queue_type (sending buffer).
 * Add typedef st_asio_wrapper::socket::out_container_type to represent the container type used by out_queue_type (receiving buffer).
 * Generalize function send_msg, send_native_msg, safe_send_msg, safe_send_native_msg, broadcast_msg, broadcast_native_msg,
 *  safe_broadcast_msg and safe_broadcast_native_msg.
 *
 * DELETION:
 * Deleted macro ST_ASIO_SEND_BUFFER_TYPE.
 * Deleted virtual function bool st_asio_wrapper::socket::on_msg().
 * Not support sync sending mode any more, so we reduced an atomic object in st_asio_wrapper::socket.
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 * If you want to change unpacker at runtime, first, you must define macro ST_ASIO_PASSIVE_RECV, second, you must call st_asio_wrapper::socket::recv_msg and
 *  guarantee only zero or one recv_msg invocation (include initiating and asynchronous operation, this may need mutex, please carefully design your logic),
 *  see file_client for more details.
 * Class object has been split into executor and tracked_executor, object_pool use the former, and st_asio_wrapper::socket use the latter.
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2018.8.2		version 2.1.1
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 * The data type of timer ID has been changed from unsigned char to unsigned short.
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 * Dynamically allocate timers when needed (multi-threading related behaviors kept as before, so we must introduce a mutex for st_asio_wrapper::timer object).
 *
 * FIX:
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * The range of timer ID has been expanded from [0, 256) to [0, 65536).
 * Add new macro ST_ASIO_ALIGNED_TIMER to align timers.
 *
 * DELETION:
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 * Realigned member variables for st_asio_wrapper::socket to save a few memory.
 * Make demos more easier to use.
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2018.8.22	version 2.1.2
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 * If macro ST_ASIO_PASSIVE_RECV been defined, you may receive an empty message in on_msg_handle(), this makes you always having
 *  the chance to call recv_msg().
 * i_unpacker has been moved from namespace st_asio_wrapper::tcp and st_asio_wrapper::udp to namespace st_asio_wrapper, and the signature of
 *  st_asio_wrapper::udp::i_unpacker::parse_msg has been changed to obey st_asio_wrapper::tcp::i_unpacker::parse_msg.
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 * Fully support sync message sending and receiving (even be able to mix with async message sending and receiving without any limitations), but please note
 *  that this feature will slightly impact efficiency even if you always use async message sending and receiving, so only open this feature when really needed.
 *
 * FIX:
 * Fix race condition when aligning timers, see macro ST_ASIO_ALIGNED_TIMER for more details.
 * Fix error check for UDP on cygwin and mingw.
 * Fix bug: demo file_client may not be able to receive all content of the file it required if you get more than one file in a single request.
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Add new macro ST_ASIO_SYNC_SEND and ST_ASIO_SYNC_RECV to support sync message sending and receiving.
 *
 * DELETION:
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 * i_unpacker has been moved from namespace st_asio_wrapper::tcp and st_asio_wrapper::udp to namespace st_asio_wrapper, and the signature of
 *  st_asio_wrapper::udp::i_unpacker::parse_msg has been changed to obey st_asio_wrapper::tcp::i_unpacker::parse_msg, the purpose of this change is to make
 *  socket::sync_recv_msg() can be easily implemented, otherwise, sync_recv_msg() must be implemented by tcp::socket_base and udp::socket_base respectively.
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2018.10.1	version 2.1.3
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 * With sync message sending, if you rewrite virtual function on_close, you must also call super class' on_close.
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 * Support sync message dispatching, it's like previous on_msg() callback but with a message container instead of a message (and many other
 *  differences, see macro ST_ASIO_SYNC_DISPATCH for more details), and we also name it on_msg().
 * Support timed waiting when doing sync message sending and receiving.
 * Support pre-creating server sockets in server_base (before accepting connections), this is very useful if creating server socket is very expensive.
 *
 * FIX:
 * Fix spurious awakenings when doing sync message sending and receiving.
 * Fix statistics for batch message dispatching.
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Add virtual function find_socket to interface i_server.
 * Support timed waiting when doing sync message sending and receiving, please note that after timeout, sync operations can succeed in the future because
 *  st_asio_wrapper uses async operations to simulate sync operations. for sync receiving, missed messages can be dispatched via the next sync receiving,
 *  on_msg (if macro ST_ASIO_SYNC_DISPATCH been defined) and / or on_msg_handle.
 * Add virtual function server_socket_base::async_accept_num() to support pre-creating server sockets at runtime, by default, it returns ST_ASIO_ASYNC_ACCEPT_NUM,
 *  see demo concurrent_server and macro ST_ASIO_ASYNC_ACCEPT_NUM for more details.

 * REPLACEMENTS:
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2019.1.1		version 2.1.4
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 * The virtual function socket::on_send_error has been moved to tcp::socket_base and udp::socket_base.
 * The signature of virtual function socket::on_send_error has been changed, a container holding messages that were failed to send will be provided.
 * Failure of binding or listening in server_base will not stop the service_pump any more.
 * Virtual function client_socket_base::prepare_reconnect() now only control the retry times and delay time after reconnecting failed.
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 *
 * FIX:
 * If give up connecting (prepare_reconnect returns -1 or call close_reconnect), st_asio_wrapper::socket::started() still returns true (should be false).
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Expose server_base's acceptor via next_layer().
 * Prefix suffix packer and unpacker support heartbeat.
 * New demo socket_management demonstrates how to manage sockets if you use other keys rather than the original id.
 * Control reconnecting more flexibly, see function client_socket_base::open_reconnect and client_socket_base::close_reconnect for more details.
 * client_socket_base support binding to a specific local address.

 * REFACTORING:
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2019.3.3		version 2.2.0
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 * Socket used by tcp::multi_client_base, ssl::multi_client_base and udp::multi_socket_service needs to provide a constructor which accept
 *  a reference of i_matrix instead of a reference of boost::asio::io_context.
 * Limit send and recv buffers by actual utilization (in byte) rather than message number before, so macro ST_ASIO_MAX_MSG_NUM been renamed to
 *  ST_ASIO_MAX_SEND_BUF and ST_ASIO_MAX_RECV_BUF, and unit been changed to byte.
 * statistic.send_msg_sum may be bigger than before (but statistic.send_byte_sum will be the same), see ENHANCEMENTS section for more details.
 * Use st_asio_wrapper::list instead of boost::container::list, the former guarantee that emplace_back() function always return the reference of
 *  the newly added item.
 * Make function tcp::socket_base::reset to be virtual.
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 * Make client_socket_base be able to call multi_client_base (via i_matrix) like server_socket_base call server_base (via i_server),
 *  and so does ssl::client_socket_base and udp::socket_base.
 * Promote performance by reducing memory replications if you already generated the message body and it can be swapped into st_asio_wrapper.
 * Introduce shared_mutex, it can promote performance if you find or traverse (via do_something_to_all or do_something_to_one) objects frequently.
 *
 * FIX:
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Introduce macro ST_ASIO_RECONNECT to control the default switch of reconnecting mechanism.
 * Introduce macro ST_ASIO_HIDE_WARNINGS to hide compilation warnings generated by st_asio_wrapper.
 * Introduce macro ST_ASIO_SHARED_MUTEX_TYPE and ST_ASIO_SHARED_LOCK_TYPE, they're used during searching or traversing (via do_something_to_all or
 *  do_something_to_one) objects in object_pool, if you search or traverse objects frequently, use shared_mutex and shared_lock instead of mutex
 *  and unique_lock will promote performance, otherwise, do not define these two macros (so they will be mutex and unique_lock by default).
 * Introduce three additional overloads of pack_msg virtual function to i_packer, they accept one or more than one i_packer::msg_type (not packed) that belong to
 *  the same message.
 * Add three overloads to send_(native_)msg, safe_send_(native_)msg, sync_send_(native_)msg and sync_safe_send_(native_)msg respectively (just on TCP),
 *  they accept one or more than one rvalue reference of in_msg_type, this will reduce one memory replication, and the statistic.send_msg_sum will be one bigger
 *  than before because the packer will add an additional message just represent the header to avoid copying the message bodies.
 * Control send and recv buffer accurately rather than just message number before, see macro ST_ASIO_MAX_SEND_BUF and ST_ASIO_MAX_RECV_BUF for more details.
 * direct_send_msg and direct_sync_send_msg support batch operation.
 * Introduce virtual function type_name() and type_id() to st_asio_wrapper::socket, they can identify whether a given two st_asio_wrapper::socket has the same type.
 * force_shutdown and graceful_shutdown support reconnecting even if the link has broken.
 *
 * DELETION:
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 * Unify all container to st_asio_wrapper::list (before, some of them were boost::container::list).
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2019.4.6		version 2.2.1
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 * Rename replaceable_unpacker to unpacker2, replaceable_udp_unpacker to udp_unpacker2, replaceable_packer to packer2, because their names confuse
 *  users, any packer or unpacker is replaceable for those packer or unpacker that has the same msg_type.
 * Drop the 'reset' parameter in multi_socket_service::add_socket, this means never call reset() for the socket anymore.
 * Don't call reset() in single_socket_service::init() and multi_socket_service::init() any more.
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 *
 * FIX:
 * Disable warnings C4521 and C4521 for Visual C++.
 * Fix corrupt boost::future because of the deletion of the owner (boost::promise).
 * Fix infinite waiting after sync message sending or receiving failed.
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Extract function start_listen from current implementations.
 * Support concurrency hint for io_context if possible.
 * Demonstrate how to accept just one client at server endpoint in demo echo_server.
 * Demonstrate how to change local address if the binding was failed (in demo udp_test).

 * Rename udp::multi_service_base to multi_socket_service_base.
 * Rename ext::udp::single_service to single_socket_service.
 * Rename ext::udp::multi_service to multi_socket_service.
 * Rename ext::udp::service to socket_service.
 * Rename socket::get_pending_send_msg_num to get_pending_send_msg_size and socket::get_pending_recv_msg_num to get_pending_recv_msg_size,
 *  and the return value not means message entries any more, but total size of all messages.
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 * Introduce new class single_service_pump--one service_pump for one service.
 * Demonstrate how to use single_service_pump in demo echo_server and client.
 *
 * FIX:
 * service_pump::stop_service() get stuck on boost-1.70.
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Class statistic support operator+, -= and -.
 * Guarantee 100% safety when reusing or freeing socket objects on all editions of boost (before, this guarantee only available on boost 1.55 ~ 1.69).
 *
 * DELETION:
 * Undefine macro ST_ASIO_FULL_STATISTIC for demo echo_server, it impacts performance a lot.

 * Always move unparsed data to the head of the buffer in unpacker and unpacker2.
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 *
 * FIX:
 * Restore the default value of parameter duration and can_overflow in all message sending interfaces (a defect introduced in version 2.1.0).
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Introduce macro ST_ASIO_EXPOSE_SEND_INTERFACE to expose send_msg() interface, see below for more details.
 * Always move unparsed data to the head of the buffer in unpacker and unpacker2.
 *
 * DELETION:
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 * Move unpacker logic from tcp::socket_base and udp::socket_base to st_asio_wrapper::socket.
 * Move message sending and receiving logic from tcp::socket_base and udp::socket_base to st_asio_wrapper::socket.
 * Some trivial refactoring in demo file_server and file_client.
 * Some new comments in demo echo_server, echo_client and file_client to help users to understand on_msg and on_msg_handle interface more.
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2020.1.1            version 2.3.0
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 * Add a new parameter prior to send_msg (series) function (after can_overflow).
 * Delete macro ST_ASIO_ENHANCED_STABILITY, which means now we always have it, if you really don't want it, define macro ST_ASIO_NO_TRY_CATCH.
 * Change macro ST_ASIO_LLF from %lu or %llu to %ld or %lld, this can shorten the output during printing invalid ids ((boost::uint_fast64_t) -1).
 * Apply the same reconnecting mechanism for message unpacking error (before, we always disabled reconnecting mechanism).
 * Interface i_unpacker::reset now is a pure virtual function, unpackers must explicitly implement it even it's an empty function since you
 *  have nothing to reset, this urges you to be aware of the importance of the interface.
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 * Support batch message sent notification, see new macro ST_ASIO_WANT_BATCH_MSG_SEND_NOTIFY for more details.
 * Support discarding oldest messages before sending message if the send buffer is insufficient, see macro ST_ASIO_SHRINK_SEND_BUFFER for more details.
 *  if you open this feature, you must not call following functions (from the packer) to pack messages:
 *  virtual bool pack_msg(msg_type& msg, container_type& msg_can);
 *  virtual bool pack_msg(msg_type& msg1, msg_type& msg2, container_type& msg_can);
 *  virtual bool pack_msg(container_type& in, container_type& out);
 *  or send_msg (series) functions which accept in_msg_type& or Packer::container_type& parameters to send messages.
 * Add a new parameter 'prior' to send_msg (series) function (after can_overflow), it has default value 'false', so legacy code can be compiled
 *  without any modifications and brings no impacts. if set to true, message will be inserted into the front of the send buffer, so you must
 *  not call following functions (from the packer) to pack messages:
 *  virtual bool pack_msg(msg_type& msg, container_type& msg_can);
 *  virtual bool pack_msg(msg_type& msg1, msg_type& msg2, container_type& msg_can);
 *  virtual bool pack_msg(container_type& in, container_type& out);
 *  or send_msg (series) functions which accept in_msg_type& or Packer::container_type& parameters to send messages.
 *
 * FIX:
 * If defined macro ST_ASIO_WANT_MSG_SEND_NOTIFY, virtual function st_asio_wrapper::socket::on_msg_send(InMsgType& msg) must be implemented.
 * If defined macro ST_ASIO_WANT_ALL_MSG_SEND_NOTIFY, virtual function st_asio_wrapper::socket::on_all_msg_send(InMsgType& msg) must be implemented.
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Support strict heartbeat sending, see macro ST_ASIO_ALWAYS_SEND_HEARTBEAT for more details.
 * Add socket_exist interface to i_matrix, it calls object_pool::exist to check the existence of a socket by an given id.
 * Add following 3 interfaces to i_unpacker as i_packer did (the default implementation is meaningless as i_packer, just satisfy compilers):
 *  virtual char* raw_data(msg_type& msg) const
 *  virtual const char* raw_data(msg_ctype& msg) const
 *  virtual size_t raw_data_len(msg_ctype& msg) const
 * Prefix the socket id (generated by st_asio_wrapper) for all logs.
 * Prefix thread id for all logs.
 * Make the link status available via tcp::socket_base::get_link_status().
 * send_msg (series) support char[] as the input source.
 *
 * DELETION:
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 * Move macro definitions from cpp files to makefile for demo file_server (to avoid potential inconsistent definitions between
 *  more than one cpp files, all other demos have only one cpp file, so have no such potential risk).
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 * Replace macro ST_ASIO_ENHANCED_STABILITY by ST_ASIO_NO_TRY_CATCH (antonymous).
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2020.5.24	version 2.3.1
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 * Rename auto_buffer to unique_buffer.
 * Rename function i_service::is_started() to i_service::service_started().
 * Introduce new interface i_unpacker::dump_left_data() to dump unparsed data when unpacking failed in on_unpack_error().
 * A additional parameter named 'init' is added to interface i_server::restore_socket, now it has following signature:
 *  virtual bool i_server::restore_socket(const boost::shared_ptr<tracked_executor>& socket_ptr, boost::uint_fast64_t id, bool init)
 *  you use init = true to initialize the server_socket's id (use macro ST_ASIO_START_OBJECT_ID to separate your id rang from object_pool's id rang),
 *  use init = false to restore a server_socket after client_socket reconnected to the server.
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 * Introduce new macro ST_ASIO_START_OBJECT_ID to set the start id that object_pool used to assign object ids, and the new function
 *  object_pool::set_start_object_id(boost::uint_fast64_t) with the same purpose, please call it as immediately as possible.
 * Support changing the size of send buffer and recv buffer at runtime.
 * Make function server_base::start_listen() and server_base::stop_listen() thread safe.
 * packer2 now can customize the real message type (before, it's always string_buffer).
 * Optimize unpacker2.
 * Support UNIX domain socket.
 * Introduce new demo unix_socket and unix_udp_test.
 *
 * FIX:
 * Fix fatal bug: message can be lost during normal dispatching (one by one).
 * Fix bug: shutdown operation causes async_connect invocation to return successful.
 * Fix the closure of UDP socket.
 * Fix race condition during call acceptor::async_accept concurrently.
 * Fix race condition during closing and ssl handshaking.
 * Fix possibility of memory leaks for unique_buffer.
 * Supplement packer2's static function -- get_max_msg_size().
 * Fix alias.
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Try parsing messages even errors occurred.
 * The usage rate of send buffer and recv buffer now can be fetched via send_buf_usage(), recv_buf_usage() or show_status().
 * Show establishment time, broken time, last send time and last recv time in show_status().
 * Standardize unique_buffer and shared_buffer.
 * Enhance basic_buffer to support pre-allocated buffers.
 * Release st_asio_wrapper::socket's function void id(uint_fast64_t id) for single client (both tcp and udp).
 * Catch more general exceptions (std::exception instead of boost::asio::system_error) in service_pump.
 *
 * DELETION:
 *
 * REFACTORING:
 * unique_buffer and shared_buffer.
 *
 * REPLACEMENTS:
 *
 * ===============================================================
 * 2020.10.1	version 2.3.2
 *
 * SPECIAL ATTENTION (incompatible with old editions):
 * UDP socket will remove itself (in on_recv_error) from udp::multi_socket_service_base if it is created by the latter and the error_code is
 *  not abort, which means is not caused by intentionally shutdown.
 * TCP client socket will remove itself (in on_recv_error) from tcp::multi_client_base if it is created by the latter and reconnecting is closed.
 * Make function void i_unpacker::stripped(bool) to be virtual.
 * To use the original default packer and unpacker, now you must write them as packer<> and unpacker<>.
 *
 * HIGHLIGHT:
 * Introduce del_socket to i_matrix, so socket can remove itself from the container (object_pool and its subclasses) who created it.
 * Add SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxy support, demo client demonstrated how to use them (been commented out).
 * Add flexible_unpacker--an unpacker which support huge messages but with a limited pre-allocated buffer (4000 bytes).
 * Introduce resize, reserve and append concept to basic_buffer (as the std::string), basic_buffer is expected to be a substitute of std::string
 *  as a receive buffer in unpackers, as a receive buffer, std::string has a defect, we cannot extend its size without fill the buffer, reserve
 *  will not fill the buffer, but will not change the size neither, resize will change the size, but will fill the buffer too.
 *
 * FIX:
 * Call the unpacker's dump_left_data() for SSL socket too.
 * Fix hex printing in function dump_left_data.
 * Make the destructor of class auto_duration to be virtual.
 * Make the destructor of class basic_buffer to be virtual.
 *
 * ENHANCEMENTS:
 * Optimize unpackers (return a value as big as possible to read data as much as possible in just one reading invocation).
 * Enhance the default packer and unpacker to support basic_buffer as their output message type.
 * Enhance packer2 and unpacker2 to support unique_buffer<basic_buffer> and shared_buffer<basic_buffer> as their output message type.
 * server_base and multi_client_base support directly broadcast messages (via broadcast_native_msg).
 * A small optimization for message sending (use message replication rather than parsing message if available).
 * In object_pool, object's in_msg_type, in_msg_ctype, out_msg_type and out_msg_ctype now are visible, you may need them in multi_client_base,
 *  server_base and udp::multi_socket_service_base.

//the answer is, we can rewrite virtual function server_socket_base::start_next_accept() and decide whether to continue the async accepting or not,
// for example, you normally have about 1000 connections, so you define ST_ASIO_ASYNC_ACCEPT_NUM as 1000, and:
// 1. rewrite virtual function server_socket_base::on_accept() and count how many connections already established;

// this feature is recommended because it can slightly improve efficiency.
//now we have three ways to handle messages (sync_recv_msg, on_msg and on_msg_handle), the invocation order is the same as listed, if messages been successfully
// dispatched to sync_recv_msg, then the second two will not be called, otherwise messages will be dispatched to on_msg, if on_msg only handled a part of (include
// zero) the messages, then on_msg_handle will continue to dispatch the rest of them asynchronously, this will disorder messages because on_msg_handle and the next
// on_msg (new messages arrived) can be invoked concurrently, and on_msg will block the next receiving and sending, but only on current socket, please note.
//if you cannot handle all of the messages in on_msg (like echo_server), you should not use sync message dispatching except you can bear message disordering.
